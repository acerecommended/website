                  <br>Recommendation: "He is very accepting, patient and open-minded. For example, I came out as queer, and he was very supportive. In Sydney especially, it is 
                  very hard to find a doctor (especially if you're from a multicultural background) who will not be dismissive of you, especially if your symptoms are not very 
                  obvious. So I would reccommend this doctor for anyone in the Parramatta area needing a GP who won't judge them, and will take their concerns seriously. I felt 
                  very comfortable with him, as he explained concepts that I was confused about, and will ask consent/explain procedures before they happen.
                  He has seen other patients from multicultural, neurodiverse and queer backgrounds. He works with a wide range of patients, and has experience in both physical and mental health 
                  issues. Since he is a GP, I have found he has a general knowledge about these issues, but he is always willing to do research and tries his best to help you 
                  find the services you need."

                  <br>Recommendation: Been there 3 times for routine OBGYN check ups. She is extremely patient, kind, and understanding. She explained the process and gives me 
                  the autonomy to leave if I feel uncomfortable. I got pap smears done, which are not pleasant but even if abstinent, that area should still get checked for 
                  cancer and other problems. My first visit, I couldn't go through with the pain and she was more than kind about it. It was her kindness that gave me strength 
                  to come back back and get the tests done successfully. She's never brought up my asexuality once since I told her on my first visit, nor has alluded to it. 
                  I cannot recommend her enough as an ace.

                  <br>Recommendation: She already was aware enough of asexuality when I came in to know how to ask if I was sexually active or intending to be in the future and not 
                  assume anything just because I was asexual, seemed familiar with the orientation and also very gentle for a first time pap smear/first ever pelvic exam, which I had 
                  at age 28, later in age than many people receive their first of this type of exam. She used a smaller speculum and was compassionate and thorough.

                  <br>Recommendation: Great ace-friendly primary care provider. She did not assume my orientation or gender when we first met and even suggested that something I said sounded demisexual. 
                  Shocked that she knew that term, I felt comfortable & told her that I was indeed ace and she responded very respectfully. There have never been any issues surrounding my identity. She is a 
                  very empathetic and patient doctor who takes the time to listen and help you without rushing the appointment. She’s mental-health conscious and is very consent-aware too. She is my primary care 
                  provider and if she needs a second opinion, she will bring in the main Doctor to take a look. I get anxiety around medical things and Nurse Schaffer creates a safe, comfortable atmosphere that 
                  really eases fear. From what I hear, the other primary care providers at the practice are LGBTQIA+ affirming too. Highly recommend to fellow ace siblings!

                  <br>Many plans! List available on website listed above. 
                  <br>Recommendation: After many bad experiences with multiple gynecologists, I was very hesitant to visit Dr. Cohen, especially as he is an 
                  older, white, cis man. BUT! He IMMEDIATELY accepted everything about my identity—my asexuality, my gender (not cis), and my 
                  strong desire to NOT have children—and understood how all of those things might impact my gynecological needs! He was the 
                  first gynecologist to really consider my symptoms, and it’s thanks to him—and the surgeon he sent me to—that my life has changed! 
                  I recommend him wholeheartedly, for both his medical acumen and his understanding & acceptance that being asexual shouldn’t be 
                  considered a symptom of anything, but rather just a thing some people are.

                  <br>Recommendation: Caroline is very nice and understanding! When I talked to her about getting a hormone check (at the time, I was hesitant to embrace the ace identity), 
                  she steered me away from that and went on to talk about sexuality. She didn’t even want to assume my gender and asked if I was sure I’m a cis female (yes). She also asked 
                  me questions about who I was attracted to and whatnot.  She went on to talk about how sexuality is different for everyone, and not being sexually attracted to people isn’t 
                  a bad thing and is actually fairly normal. She reassured me that there is nothing wrong with me, and I could find a partner who is compatible with me. Anyway, very open-minded 
                  and kind woman (even though I came with difficult questions about sexuality!).
