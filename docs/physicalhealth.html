              <p>Profession: Primary Care, Nurse Practioner

                  <br>(508) 784-1278 | 9 Trolley Crossing Road, Charlton, MA 01507
         
                  <br>Recommendation: Great ace-friendly primary care provider. She did not assume my orientation or gender when we first met and even suggested that something I said sounded demisexual. Shocked that she knew that term, I felt comfortable & told her that I was indeed ace and she responded very respectfully. There have never been any issues surrounding my identity. She is a very empathetic and patient doctor who takes the time to listen and help you without rushing the appointment. She’s mental-health conscious and is very consent-aware too. She is my primary care provider and if she needs a second opinion, she will bring in the main Doctor to take a look. I get anxiety around medical things and Nurse Schaffer creates a safe, comfortable atmosphere that really eases fear. From what I hear, the other primary care providers at the practice are LGBTQIA+ affirming too. Highly recommend to fellow ace siblings!

            <h4>Dr. Arthur Cohen</h4>
              <p>Profession: Gynecologist
                  <br>Website: <a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1447234596/arthur-cohen" target="_blank">NYU Langone Arthur Cohen</a> 
                  <br>(516) 437-5547 | 2001 Marcus Ave Ste 265 S Lake Success NY 11042 United States
                  <br>Many plans! List available on website listed above. 
                  <br>Recommendation: After many bad experiences with multiple gynecologists, I was very hesitant to visit Dr. Cohen, especially as he is an 
                  older, white, cis man. BUT! He IMMEDIATELY accepted everything about my identity—my asexuality, my gender (not cis), and my 
                  strong desire to NOT have children—and understood how all of those things might impact my gynecological needs! He was the 
                  first gynecologist to really consider my symptoms, and it’s thanks to him—and the surgeon he sent me to—that my life has changed! 
                  I recommend him wholeheartedly, for both his medical acumen and his understanding & acceptance that being asexual shouldn’t be 
                  considered a symptom of anything, but rather just a thing some people are.

                  <br>Insurance: Blue Cross Blue Shield & others
                  <br>Recommendation: Several years ago I saw a doctor who gave me a PAP even though I had said that I never had sex, and it was a terrible experience. 
                  When I started seeing Kim, I told her I was ace, and she has accepted it at face value. She put off all my PAPs and continues to delay them to the best 
                  of her ability. She's never made a big deal out of it, and I'm grateful to have her!
