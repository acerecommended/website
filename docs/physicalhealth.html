            <h4>Dr. Arthur Cohen</h4>
              <p>Profession: Gynecologist
                  <br>Website: <a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1447234596/arthur-cohen" target="_blank">NYU Langone Arthur Cohen</a> 
                  <br>(516) 437-5547 | 2001 Marcus Ave Ste 265 S Lake Success NY 11042 United States
                  <br>Many plans! List available on website listed above. 
                  <br>Recommendation: After many bad experiences with multiple gynecologists, I was very hesitant to visit Dr. Cohen, especially as he is an 
                  older, white, cis man. BUT! He IMMEDIATELY accepted everything about my identity—my asexuality, my gender (not cis), and my 
                  strong desire to NOT have children—and understood how all of those things might impact my gynecological needs! He was the 
                  first gynecologist to really consider my symptoms, and it’s thanks to him—and the surgeon he sent me to—that my life has changed! 
                  I recommend him wholeheartedly, for both his medical acumen and his understanding & acceptance that being asexual shouldn’t be 
                  considered a symptom of anything, but rather just a thing some people are.
