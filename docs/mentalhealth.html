                      empathy to the challenging work of each session. Tara’s practice is filtered through a strengths-based and feminist lens, and she actively promotes anti-racism, body empowerment, 
                      dismantling diet culture, and sex- and kink- positivity. As a trauma survivor, living with depression and anxiety herself, she seeks to incorporate evidence-based interventions 
                      with warmth, passion, and hope.

                  <br>Recommendation: Melissa focuses on Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, which is largely concerned with what's effective rather that what's "supposed to work." Between that and EMDR, I can now hold down a job and be within 3 feet of a male without having a panic attack. I've been in therapy for 13 years and seen 6 different therapists, and Melissa is the only one who's actually helped me.

                  <br>Recommendation: John is primarily a gender services therapist, and is very skilled in helping trans/non-binary/gender non-conforming people figure out what is right for them and then, if necessary, connecting them with the professionals they need to make those things a reality. His practice is not limited to gender issues, though, and he is not only knowledgeable on the subject of asexuality but also always curious to learn more. Trans aces can sometimes face skepticism from therapists they they're only asexual because they have dysphoria, but I would not hesitate to send any trans ace to John.

Had it not been for the lockdown I could still be seeing him right now, as I've had two other counsellors since by phone only.
