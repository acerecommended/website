                  <br>Recommendation: I received therapy services from Stephanie for ~1 year, and she was one of the best therapists I've had. Very intentional, open and affirming. Even though we didn't necessarily discuss asexuality as a Topic in and of itself, I brought up asexuality and my experiences being acespec several times in relation to other things and she was always very affirming and non-judgmental.
