                  <br>Fees: $220 AUD per 50 min session. | Insurance: They take 10Xper year standard Medicare (government) rebate to reduce cost for those ten sessions. 
                  <br>Recommendation: I'm an (ace) client and Jhocelyn has been really understanding with me about my aceness.  I had a horror run finding a nice therapist that even accepted someone could be asexual.

                  <br>Recommendation: I’ve seen a few therapists, two of whom were super helpful, but Kirsty was definitely the best. Not only was she never judgemental about anything, but she 
                  also helped run the queer group that met every month. She didn’t know what aromanticism or asexuality were, but when I explained it she thanked me for sharing it, and congratulated 
                  me on finding out who I was. As a whole, I think Headspace Gold Coast is very open minded and queer friendly

                  <br>Recommendation: Of all the therapists I’ve worked with, Adam was by far the most impactful. He created a space where I felt truly seen and understood. I think his openness 
                  made all the difference. For anyone exploring or questioning their asexual identity, I highly recommend finding a therapist who is not only supportive but also genuinely curious. 
                  He made my journey to self-acceptance much smoother.

                  <br>Description: She's ace (and maybe aro?) herself so she's extremely understanding of those orientations and how hard it is to be acknowledged. She doesn't ever 
                  judge, she listens and believes everything you say, and she's so good at helping you think through things and understand yourself and how to grow as a person. She's 
                  also disabled which makes her incredibly sympathetic to how people struggle with ableism specifically and "otherness" in general.

                      empathy to the challenging work of each session. Tara’s practice is filtered through a strengths-based and feminist lens, and she actively promotes anti-racism, body empowerment, 
                      dismantling diet culture, and sex- and kink- positivity. As a trauma survivor, living with depression and anxiety herself, she seeks to incorporate evidence-based interventions 
                      with warmth, passion, and hope.

                  <br>(765) 658-4268 | Only available to Depaw University Students
                  <br>Fees: Services are only available to students enrolled at DePauw University, but no insurance is required as there are no fees.
                  <br>Recommendation: I was very lucky to have Trevor as my counselor for four years. He never made any comments about my identity and let me speak freely about my experiences. He did not make any attempt to fix my issues by focusing on my asexuality; in fact, he helped me navigate some issues 
                  where my asexuality was impacting my life. There was a time where I was having panic attacks because I had a new partner and I was nervous about telling her I was asexual, and Trevor helped me figure out a time and place to tell her, and what words to say (super helpful for me, I am neurodivergent 
                  as well). My impression is that he was one of the most knowledgeable of queer identities and experiences among the counseling staff at DePauw University. I always felt he was a safe person to talk to, about whatever I needed to talk about; he challenged me when I needed to step out of my stifling 
                  boundaries, and he respected when I said I didn't want to talk about something in that moment, but checked in later to see if my feelings had changed. With his help I was able to get diagnoses and treatment for my anxiety and depression, and he helped me start my ADHD diagnosis and suggested I 
                  seek further help for my psychosis if it came back. He is very supportive, kind, soft-spoken, respectful, easy to schedule with and contact, and he laughed at my jokes. Genuinely I don't know if I would still be here on this beautiful Earth were it not for Trevor.

                  to her at all; she's the first therapist I've ever encountered who did not need an "ace 101" speech, and she has been able to put a fair 
                  deal of my asexuality in terms that my baby boomer mother can understand more easily. She is, quite frankly, an amazing family therapist 
                  even without the queer and asexual sensitivity.

                  <br>Recommendation: I've been meeting with Misha as an Enneagram coach for the past year.  They are very affirming of me as an ace person & I didn't need to hold space for them to understand asexuality.  They hold ample space for me to question, connect to myself, and are affirming of me as I am.

                  <br>Recommendation: Nikkie has been my therapist for many years now and is by far the best therapist i've ever had. Not only does she accept 
                  my sexuality at face value, but she was very kind and sympathetic when I told her about my previous experiences with aphobia in mental healthcare. 
                  She isn't an expert in lgbt+ issues, but what sets her apart for me is that she approaches this and all topics with a humility many doctors lack; 
                  she treats me as the expert on my own experiences. She's helped me through quite a few crises over the years, and I've never felt anything but completely safe with her.

                  gray-asexual, transgender woman-identified clinician who is deeply passionate about helping clients understand how the unique intersection of their identities, cultural backgrounds, and 
                  social context can inform experiences of trauma, sources of strength and community, and shape other life challenges.
                    Chloe specializes in working LGBTQIA+ individuals (especially transgender, nonbinary, and asexual individuals), outpatient disordered eating and body image concerns, complex and

                  <br>Recommendation: John is primarily a gender services therapist, and is very skilled in helping trans/non-binary/gender non-conforming people 
                  figure out what is right for them and then, if necessary, connecting them with the professionals they need to make those things a reality. His 
                  practice is not limited to gender issues, though, and he is not only knowledgeable on the subject of asexuality but also always curious to learn 
                  more. Trans aces can sometimes face skepticism from therapists they they're only asexual because they have dysphoria, but I would not hesitate 
                  to send any trans ace to John.

I am a member of the queer community (asexual/demiromantic) and support all identities. Therapy should be supportive, fun, and effective. Change can be scary, but it is less scary when you are working with someone who believes in you and can support you in a healthy, creative, and cohesive way. I look forward to meeting you and joining you on your journey.
