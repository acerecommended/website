            <h4>AZE Journal</h4>
              <p>
                  <br>Website: <a href="www.https://azejournal.com" target="_blank">AZE Journal</a> 
                  Description: AZE is an interdisciplinary journal publishing the written and artistic reflections of asexual, aromantic, and agender people. 
                  It was first established as The Asexual (theasexual.com) in 2016 with the intention of providing visibility to the expressions of asexual 
                  people in a sexual world. The central purpose of the journal was to exist as a space for creative and critical expressions, including 
                  personal essays, poetry, visual art, and academic writing.
                    <br> Although originally focused on asexuality, the scope of the journal expanded to not just critique sexual expectations, 
                  but also romantic and gendered ones. With this transformation, the journal was renamed AZE in 2019. Appropriately noted by Janeth 
                  Montenegro Marquez, AZE was created “to give other queer individuals, queer BIPOC individuals especially, a space of community to explore their identities.”
